## How healthcare subnet of bittensor works

At the heart of this subnet are the miners - talented AI developers and teams dedicated to training and refining machine learning models. These models are not static; they are dynamic and continuously improved upon. Miners publish their latest models on Hugging Face, a platform renowned for its vast repository of AI models, making these advancements accessible to our community and beyond.

Validators, another crucial component of our ecosystem, play the pivotal role of assessing these models. They download the models from Hugging Face and evaluate them using their own diverse datasets. This evaluation isn't just a binary measure of success or failure; it is a nuanced process that involves ranking the models based on their loss metrics. The lower the loss, the higher the model ranks, reflecting its accuracy and efficiency in solving real-world problems.
